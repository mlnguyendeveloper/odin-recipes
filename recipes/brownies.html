    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> These easy brownies start with two cups of white sugar.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour creates structure in the batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Two sticks of melted butter give the brownies moisture and richness.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they help bind the batter together.</li>
        <li><strong>Cocoa powder:</strong> Of course, you'll need cocoa powder for chocolate brownies!</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the brownies.</li>
        <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the brownies rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Walnuts:</strong> Nuts are optional, of course, but they add a welcome crunch.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat oven: </strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Mix ingrediants: </strong>Mix sugar, flour, melted butter, eggs, cocoa powder, vanilla, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl until combined. Fold in chopped walnuts. Spread the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven until top is dry and edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 20 to 30 minutes; cool before slicing into squares.</li>
